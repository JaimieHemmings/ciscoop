## W3c CSS Validator

- [CSS Validation results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fciscoop-46d70b5281a0.herokuapp.com%2Findex&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

As seen by the results, I have no errors in my CSS, although I do have warnings for the case of CSS Variables not being checked. The warning about CSS Variables is the overwhelming majority of the warnings with several others being for vendor prefixes. Additionally, these errors are coming from the Bootstrap 5 stylsheets which I have no direct control over.
